# Security

When it comes to security, it can be pretty hard to keep trackers away from your system. In this article, we will be reviewing some good
security tips and how good your security is. Let's get started.











# Am I Hacked?

Ok, lets say you think that you are hacked and you are reading this so you can find out if you are hacked or not.
Well, here we will be showing you signs that you are being hacked. 

#1 Moving Cursor: If you're cursor is moving by itself then you are definitely being hacked, <strong>BUT WAIT!</strong> Before you
assure that you are hacked due to this reason, check if you made your cursor or mouse move by itself accidentely. Maybe you just
have a sensitive mouse.


#2 Microphone Or Camera: If you notice that your camera is on, check to see if any app is using your camera or microphone. If not, then most
likely someone has control of your system.
 

#3 Unknown Files: You might see files you don't remember seeing in your device. Check if you recently created a new file, If you
didn't, you may have been hacked,
 
 


# What If I Am Hacked?


If you were hacked, then the best thing to do is disconnect from your home Wi-Fi Network. This way, the hacker cannot access your device since there is no internet
to let the hacker go through. When you turn the Wi-Fi back on, you can do the follwoing:

#1 Use VPN
<br>
#2 Install A Firewall
<br>
#3 Use A Good Antivirus
<br>
#4 Use Livepatch (Only For Linux Users)
<br>
#5 Try The Antivirus That Originally Came With Your Device











# What About My Built In Security?

Some people don't know if they have good security on their operating system or not. Well that's what we will be reviwing in this section.
Let's see:













# Linux

Linux has the best security out of all operating system, even more than MacOS's. That's a fact! If you are considering switching to Linux, you would have
high built in security. You don't even have to install and Antivirus or Firewall.












# MacOS

MacOS is known for it's good features and user interface. However, it doesn't have the best security. You may need to install
a Firewall or Antivirus if you want excellent security. Otherwise, the security is fine.

















# Windows

If you are a Windows user, I highly reccomend that you use a security method. Windows doesn't have good security built in.
Windows is not known well for security at all, so you better install a Firewall or use a VPN. If that doesn't work for
you, find another method because no security method on Windows isn't safe for your data at all.
